AVIATION SAFETY DISCLAIMER AND TERMS OF USE:

1. Reference Tool Only:
   This software is designed solely as a preliminary reference tool for weight
   and balance calculations. It is NOT a replacement for official aircraft
   documentation or proper flight planning procedures.

2. Pilot Responsibility:
   - Every pilot must verify all weight and balance calculations using their
     specific aircraft's Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) before each flight.
   - Aircraft configurations, modifications, and equipment changes can affect
     weight and balance calculations. Users must account for their specific
     aircraft's current configuration.
   - The pilot-in-command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for ensuring the
     aircraft is operated within its approved weight and balance envelope.

3. Aircraft Specificity:
   - The data provided in this tool is based on generic aircraft models and
     may not reflect the exact characteristics of any specific aircraft.
   - Individual aircraft may have different empty weights, moment arms, and
     limitations based on modifications, equipment installations, or repairs.

4. Verification Requirement:
   - All calculations must be verified against the aircraft's specific POH
     and weight and balance documentation.
   - This tool should never be used as the sole source for weight and
     balance calculations.

5. Currency of Information:
   - Aircraft performance data and limitations may change over time through
     service bulletins, airworthiness directives, or manufacturer updates.
   - Users must ensure they are using current documentation for their specific
     aircraft.

6. Training and Competency:
   - Users of this software should have proper training in weight and balance
     calculations and understand the implications of loading on aircraft
     performance.
   - This tool is not a substitute for proper flight planning training and
     experience.
